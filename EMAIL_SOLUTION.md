# Email Solution - Simple Mailto Implementation

## Current Solution
The contact form now uses a **mailto link** which:
- ✅ Works immediately without backend setup
- ✅ Opens user's default email client
- ✅ Pre-fills recipient, subject, and message
- ✅ No server configuration needed

## How It Works
1. User fills out the contact form
2. Clicks "Send Message" 
3. Their email client opens with pre-filled email to `karthick123svks@gmail.com`
4. User clicks send in their email client
5. Email is delivered directly
